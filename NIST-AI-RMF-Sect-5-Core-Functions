Section 5 is all about the structure and use of NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework. It’s a lengthy section so I’ll be breaking it down into more manageable chunks.
5 AI RMF CORE FUNCTIONS

The Core provides four high-level functions — GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, AND MANAGE — to manage AI risks. Each function has internal categories which include actions and outcomes, though they aren’t necessarily an ordered set of steps.
    GOVERN strives to ensure risk management is part of an organization’s culture. This function should be the first an organization puts in place.
    MAP recognizes the context of AI use and identifies risks.
    MEASURE assesses, analyzes and tracks the risks identified by Map.
    MANAGE prioritizes and takes action according to the risks assessments of Measure.

The RMF should be used it as to suit users’ needs based on their resources and capabilities. Once a governance structure is in place MAP is a natural starting point, though functions and actions can be performed as deemed necessary to add value and mitigate emerging AI risks.

The Core are a continual process and should be carried out by multidisciplinary teams with diverse views and talents. A diverse team contributes to surfacing problems and identifying existing and future risks. NIST also provides the AI RMF Playbook (found on NIST’s website) to help with implemention.
