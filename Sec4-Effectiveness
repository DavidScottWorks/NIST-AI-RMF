Measuring the framework’s effectiveness will be done collaboratively with the AI community. Everyone using the AI RMF is encouraged to share their experiences and suggestions for improving the framework with NIST. The goals are for users to benefit from:

    --better processes for governing, mapping, measuring and managing AI risks
    --improved awareness of the trade-offs involved
    --explicit go/no-go AI use decisions
    --establishing policies and procedures for improved accountability
    --greater culture for identifying and managing AI risks and impacts
    --better information sharing within and across organizations about risks
    --increased awareness of downstream risks
    --greater engagment with relevant AI stakeholders
    --increased capacity for test and evaluation of AI systems

This is part of my series on the National Institute of Science and Technology’s publication 100–1 AI Risk Management Framework.
